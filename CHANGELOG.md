# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Forensic marking flags: `KdmConfig` and `RewrapConfig` can disable picture
  marking, audio marking, or audio marking above a given channel, writing the
  ST 430-1 `ForensicMarkFlagList`. Marking stays on by default, and the element
  is absent then.
- `classify_kdm_window` reports whether a KDM validity window sits within,
  overlaps or falls outside a recipient certificate's own validity.
- The KDM vocabulary is public, so a command line no longer keeps its own copy:
  `KdmFormulation::ALL`, `lists_supplied_devices` and `device_list_counterpart`;
  `FromStr`, `Display` and `ALL` on `KdmFormat`; `forensic_mark_flag_uris`,
  which renders a marking pair to the ST 430-1 Annex C URIs a KDM carries; and
  the `ContentAuthenticator`, `CertificateThumbprint`, `ForensicMarkFlagList`
  and `ForensicMarkFlag` element names.

### Changed

- Timed text and Atmos wraps honour `MxfWrapOptions.encryption`, so a DCP built
  with encryption no longer ships cleartext subtitles and Atmos beside encrypted
  picture and sound. Both carry the caller's KeyId and an HMAC, as picture and
  sound already did.
- `KdmFormat` and `KdmFormulation` parse case-insensitively, so a command line
  may spell them `SMPTE` or `DCI-Any`. An empty value is still an error.
- Generated certificates are DCI-conformant: every DN value is a
  PrintableString, every tier carries a dnQualifier holding the base64 SHA-1 of
  its public key, the leaf adds `keyEncipherment`, basicConstraints path lengths
  are 3 and 2, both key identifiers are written, and `generate_chain` puts the
  ST 430-2 role token in each CommonName. Regenerate any chain postkit produced
  earlier.
- `build_kdm` and `rewrap_dkdm` refuse a validity window the recipient
  certificate could never open, and one the signer chain does not fully cover.
- One certificate thumbprint everywhere: `CertInfo.thumbprint` and
  `TrustedDevice.thumbprint` carry the base64 ST 430-2 value a KDM lists, and
  existing trusted-device stores migrate themselves on first use.
- `KdmConfig.formulation` is a typed `KdmFormulation` that emits
  `ContentAuthenticator` for the dci formulations and rejects a device list its
  formulation would discard, instead of being read by nothing.
- Every tier of a generated chain is valid for 10 years, staggered by a day per
  tier as libdcp does so a parent outlives the child it issued, and any longer
  validity is refused: DCP-o-matic rejects a signer certificate spanning more
  than 15. Regenerate any chain postkit produced earlier.
- `X509SubjectName` and `X509IssuerName` are written in RFC 4514 order, most
  specific RDN first, which is what libdcp writes and what a projector matches a
  KDM recipient against. Reissue any KDM postkit produced earlier.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-08-13

### Generated signer certificates were missing two required extensions

Regenerate any chain postkit produced earlier. Every leaf certificate came out
with no Basic Constraints and no Key Usage extension, which ST 430-2 requires,
so validators reject a package signed with one. rcgen writes no extensions at
all for `IsCa::NoCa`, and the leaf was the only certificate using it, so root
and intermediate were always correct and only the signer was affected.

### KDMs written before this release were schema-invalid

Regenerate any KDM postkit produced earlier. Three defects broke it against the
ST 430-1 schema, and each one on its own is enough for a conformant consumer to
reject the message.

- No `AuthorizedDeviceInfo` at all. ST 430-1 Annex B declares it with no
  `minOccurs`, so it is required, and postkit never wrote one.
- `Recipient/X509IssuerSerial` children were written unprefixed. The element is
  typed `ds:X509IssuerSerialType`, so `X509IssuerName` and `X509SerialNumber`
  belong in the xmldsig namespace.
- The ETM `Signer` carried a third `X509SubjectName` child. ST 430-3 types it as
  `ds:X509IssuerSerialType`, which permits issuer and serial only.

The `Recipient`'s own `X509SubjectName` was always correct and is unchanged. It
is a sibling of `X509IssuerSerial`, not a child of it.

### Certificates generated before this release fail DCI CTP 2.1.4

Regenerate them too. `generate_certificate` never set a serial number, so rcgen
fell back to 20 bytes of a public key hash. ST 430-2 5.2 requires an unsigned
integer of 64 bits or less, and CTP 2.1.4 fails anything larger. Serials are now
random 63-bit values.

### Added

- `KdmConfig.device_cert_files` and `RewrapConfig.device_cert_files` restrict a
  KDM to named playback devices by certificate thumbprint. Empty, the default,
  emits the DCI assume-trust thumbprint alone.
- `AccessibilityTrack::VisuallyImpairedText` for the ST 2067-2
  `VisuallyImpairedTextSequence`, separate from `AudioDescription` because it is
  text a renderer speaks rather than a narration channel carried as audio.

### Changed

- `AccessibilityTrack` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so matches in other crates need a
  wildcard arm.
- `dci_max_bitrate_mbps(width)` is replaced by the constant
  `DCI_MAX_BITRATE_MBPS`, and the 4K limit drops from 500 Mb/s to 250. DCSS 4.3.3
  caps a 4K frame at the same 1,302,083 bytes as 24 fps 2K, and the 500 has no
  source in DCI, ST 429-4 or ST 429-2. A 4K package between 250 and 500 Mb/s that
  passed before is now reported over the limit.
- `analyse_bitrate` lost its `width` parameter, which fed only that branch.
